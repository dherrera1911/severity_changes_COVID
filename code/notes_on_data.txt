- Denmarks second wave seroprevalence estimate is at the very beggining of the wave.

- Data in table 7 of Gornyk et al. seems to have several error

- 2 sources for German deaths, Gornyk et al and a website, are in some disagreement.
 Data in paper is deaths at "start" of study period? Weird

- Should "Radon K, Saathof E, Pritsch M, Guggenbuhl Noller JM, Kroidl I, Olbrich L,
et al. Protocol of a population‑based prospective COVID‑19 cohort study
Munich, Germany (KoCo19). BMC Public Health. 2020;20(1):1036." be the reference
for 1st wave Munich

- Options munich: Ever positive, or currently positive for prevalence

- Spain: Actual vs total historical positives

- Neuchatel seroprevalence studies: What date to take for outcomes?
They talk about "seroprevalence by October", but study took 2 months
long.

- Exclude vaccinated from Neuchatel seroprevalence? Numbers seem
to change minimally.

- Phase 4 Neuchatel, missing non-vaccinated. Ask from authors?

- Freiburg population in the table of Gornyk et al is different than the
 population at the citation from the google sheet? Yes, google sheet
refers to city, paper refers to urban + rural area
 
- Freiburg: Deaths reported in paper much larger than from public database.
Possible different geographical references? (citi vs state?). 

- Deaths by vaccination status are available for whole Switzerland but
not at the canton level

- Prevalences obtained from positive tests in Munich wave 1 is different 
from prevalences reported on Online Table S2. I can't find the reported
prevalences by age. Maybe I'm lacking test characteristics adjustment?

- From Munich wave 1 study:
While only a small proportion of the general population in Germany
live in institutions, official data of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI)
report that during the study period, 13% of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections
and 46% of COVID-19-related deaths occurred in institutionalized persons.
Therefore, we report a range of IFRs depending on the percentage of
deaths occurring in private households. 

- The majority of inpatients with Covid-19 are admitted as a result of the infection.

- England vaccination death data doesn't include late 2020

- We would be unable to provide you with COVID-19 hospitalisations by
vaccination status in the UK. To fulfil this request would require
complex data linkage and to use a high level of statistical skill and
judgement in order to create a bespoke analysis or table. Under the
Freedom of Information Act 2000, Public Authorities are not obligated
to create information in order to respond to requests. We therefore
consider this to be information not held

- Percentage vaccinated in downloaded dataset for England
different than Ward et al?

- Check if there is vaccination data for Aachen in paper
